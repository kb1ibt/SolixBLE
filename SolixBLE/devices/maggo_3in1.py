    Anker MagGo 3-in-1 Wireless Charger.

    Use this class to connect and monitor the 3-in-1 wireless charging station
    (phone MagSafe pad, Apple Watch puck and earbuds pad). This model is also
    known as the A25x7.

    .. note::
       :collapsible: closed

       Reverse-engineered from BLE captures. Like the C1000G2 it uses the same
       encryption and telemetry framing as the other Prime devices, but it
       streams nothing until it receives a subscribe command (``4200``);
       telemetry then arrives on command ``4300``.

       The three wireless pads live in TLV parameters ``a2``/``a3``/``a4``, each
       eight bytes with the ``04 <status> <2b> <2b> <power LE>`` per-port shape
       used by the Prime chargers. Per-pad power was confirmed on hardware (an
       Apple Watch charging at 2.85 W read ``a2[6:8]`` little-endian ``0x011d``
       = 285). The two intermediate fields per pad are present but their scaling
       was not confidently confirmed for the wireless pads, so only power and
       status are exposed. The report carries no dedicated total field (``a5``
       is a constant ``04ffff`` and ``a6``/``fe`` are zeros), so ``power_out``
       is computed as the sum of the three pads.
