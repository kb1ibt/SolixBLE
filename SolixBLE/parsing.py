"""Walkers for nested self-delimiting telemetry payloads.

.. moduleauthor:: kb1ibt

Most telemetry fields are flat, fixed-layout TLV that
:meth:`SolixBLE.device.SolixBLEDevice._parse_payload` decodes directly. A few fields
instead carry a *nested* self-delimiting structure that fixed offsets cannot decode,
in one of two encodings (distinguished by the value's leading type byte):

* **protobuf** (type byte ``0x07``) -- e.g. the C2000 G2's ``c490`` device summary.
  Walked by :func:`walk_protobuf`.
* **length-value** (a ``<length><value>`` sequence, type byte ``0x04`` binary) -- e.g.
  the ``ce`` combination-battery block in the C2000 G2's ``c421`` telemetry. Walked by
  :func:`walk_lv`.

Both encodings self-delimit, so a value that grows past a byte boundary never shifts
the fields after it -- the whole point over a brittle fixed-offset map.
